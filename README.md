## A scatter plot with D3.js

This graph is not meant to be taken seriously. The source data doesn't have a cited official source associated with it and the 
graph itself only shows that the racers with the top 35 fastest times were accused of doping.

It's online at https://wise-beggar.surge.sh

Used insertion sort on the original data which was an array of objects.
Sorted on an object's Year value.

The time values on the y-axis were created from an arbritrary date. I really only needed the minutes values for the axis. The Minutes values from the source are strings.

I could have used the source's Seconds value and perhaps used a library or function to convert them into minutes.
